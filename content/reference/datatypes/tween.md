## Properties


### Instance

> `Instance`
>
> The object which the tween would act upon.

<br/>

### PlaybackState

> `Enum.PlaybackState`
>
> The current state of the tween.
> 
> #### Examples:
> * `Enum.PlaybackState.Playing` - When the tween is active.
> * `Enum.PlaybackState.Cancelled` - If the tween was cancelled before it finished.
> * Reference `Enum.PlaybackState` for more states.

<br/>

## Methods


### Play()


> Triggers the tween to start/continue playing.

<br/>

### Pause()

> Pauses the tween where it is at and will continue once `Tween:Play()` is called again.

<br/>

### Cancel()

> Stops the tween where it is at and resets the tween to the start position.

<br/>

## Events

### .Completed(playbackState: `Enum.PlaybackState`)

> Fires when the tween finishes, whether it completed naturally or was
> stopped early with [`Cancel()`](#cancel).
>
> The connected function receives one argument: the resulting
> `Enum.PlaybackState`, either `Completed` or `Cancelled`.
>
> ```luau
> -- Example of the `Completed` signal being used.
> myTween.Completed:Connect(function(playbackState)
>     if playbackState == Enum.PlaybackState.Completed then
>         print("Tween finished naturally")
>     end
> end)
> ```
