title: Character
description: The runtime Model projection associated with a Player.
---

A Character is the live [`Model`](./model.md) exposed by a player's
[`Player.Character`](./player.md) field. It is not a separately constructible
Vortex class. Obtain it from the local player in a LocalScript or from a Player
returned by `Players:GetPlayers()` in a server Script.

```luau
-- LocalScript
local character = game:GetService("Players").LocalPlayer.Character
```

```luau
-- Script
local player = game:GetService("Players"):GetPlayers()[1]
local character = player and player.Character
```

## Confirmed public projection

In Vortex Studio 0.3.4, the live Character reports `ClassName == "Model"`.
The observed public fields are `ClassName`, `Name`, `Position`,
[`Humanoid`](./humanoid.md), and
[`HumanoidRootPart`](./humanoid-root-part.md). `Parent` reads as `nil`.

The tested generic Instance methods are available, including `GetChildren`,
`GetDescendants`, `FindFirstChild`, `FindFirstChildOfClass`, `WaitForChild`,
`IsA`, and the attribute/property-signal methods. The Character's tested
hierarchy and lifecycle signals are unavailable; its `Changed` signal is
connectable. Model pivot and primary-part APIs are unavailable.

`Character:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")` and
`Character:FindFirstChild("HumanoidRootPart")` resolve the same direct values
as the public fields. The tested standard R6/R15 limb names are absent from
this public projection.

## Write-only visual rotation

`Character.Orientation` is the confirmed server-side route for turning the
visible Character. Assigning `Vector3.new(0, 90, 0)` visibly quarter-turns the
character even though `Character.Orientation` is `nil` before the assignment
and remains `nil` after it. Treat it as a write-only visual command rather
than readable transform state:

```luau
character.Orientation = Vector3.new(0, 90, 0)
```

After the visual turn, `Orientation`, `Rotation`, and `CFrame` remained `nil`
on Player, Character, the public root, Humanoid, Scene, Armature, visual root,
Torso, limbs, and Head. The exposed visual hierarchy supplies `Position`
values only; it does not expose the resulting yaw for readback.

This differs from `Player.Orientation`, which retains an assigned value but
has no verified visible turn effect, and from the public
[`HumanoidRootPart`](./humanoid-root-part.md), which rejects the write.

## Visual Scene projection

`Character:GetChildren()` returns an unnamed generic `Instance`. After a short
loading delay, that wrapper can expose a separate `Scene` property containing
the rendered armature, body meshes, limbs, and avatar-specific attachments.
It is a transient renderer projection rather than normal Character hierarchy.

Once that visual Scene is available, the observed direct-member route is:

```luau
local wrapper = character:GetChildren()[1]
local scene = wrapper.Scene
local armature = scene["Armature.001"]
local visualRoot = armature.HumanoidRootPart
local torso = visualRoot.Torso
local rightLeg = torso["Right Leg"]
```

Names containing dots or spaces require bracket syntax. `HumanoidRootPart`,
`Torso`, and `Head` are direct members on their respective visual nodes. This
visual root is not the restricted public `character.HumanoidRootPart` Part
projection.

The Scene can be replaced while the Character itself remains available. A
replacement destroys old visual instances, so stored limb or accessory
references cannot be reparented into the new Scene. Resolve the current visual
Scene again whenever it is needed. See [Model: Transient Character visual
Scene](./model.md#transient-character-visual-scene) for the full observed tree,
visual-node surface, and attachment details.

The tested visual `HumanoidRootPart` and `Torso` also discard an `Orientation`
write without error: the value remains `nil` on readback. They are not a
rotation-control route.

## Lifecycle limitation

The Player's standard `CharacterAdded` signal is not exposed in the tested
runtime: it remained `nil` in both Script and LocalScript for a dedicated
15-second observation. Poll `Player.Character` and the visual Scene route
instead of waiting for that signal.
