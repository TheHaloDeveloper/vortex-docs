## Summary
> [!NOTE]
> `Lighting` is a service and cannot be `created` or `destroyed`.

There are two main controls under Lighting's properties:
- `Ambient` is the general lighting that every object receives regardless of its position or rotation.
- `Sun` is the light placed on object faces that are in direct view of the sun. If shadows are enabled, then parts of a face can be blocked from the sun.

## Properties

### Ambient Color

\
This value has `no effect`.

<br/>


### Rotation
> [`Vector3`](/content/reference/datatypes/vector3.md) \
\
Determines the angle at which sunlight hits objects, and as such the dimensions of shadows.

<br/>


### Size
> [`Vector3`](/content/reference/datatypes/vector3.md) \
\
This value is `read-only` has `no effect`.
