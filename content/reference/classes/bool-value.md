description: An unsupported Roblox-compatible boolean value container.

## Runtime support

`Instance.new("BoolValue")` is not supported in Vortex Studio 0.3.4. It fails
in both `Script` and `LocalScript` with an unable-to-create-instance error.

Use a regular Lua boolean, or an [`IntValue`](/content/reference/classes/int-value.md)
with a documented `0`/`1` convention, when you need boolean state.
