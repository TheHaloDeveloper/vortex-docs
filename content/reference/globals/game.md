## Properties

### Workspace

> [`Workspace`](/content/reference/classes/workspace.md)
>
> The root `Workspace` service.

<br/>

### Players

> [`Players`](/content/reference/classes/players.md)
>
> A direct alias for the Players service. In Vortex Studio 0.3.4 it is a
> distinct proxy table from `game:GetService("Players")`.

<br/>

## Methods

### GetService()

> `Instance`
>
> `game:GetService(serviceName: String)`
>
> Returns the service with the specified name.

#### Parameters

- `serviceName`: `String` — the name of the service to retrieve.

<br/>

## Callbacks

### OnClose

> `Function` | `nil`
>
> An optional callback that can be assigned before the game closes.

<br/>

## Services

### Workspace

> `Instance`
>
> The Workspace is the root object that holds anything that is currently in the world. [Workspace](../classes/workspace.md)

<br/>

### Players

> `Instance`
>
> The service that contains the currently connected player objects. [Players](../classes/players.md)

<br/>

### ReplicatedStorage

> `Instance`
>
> A container for instances loaded by both the server and the client. [ReplicatedStorage](../classes/replicated-storage.md)

<br/>

### StarterPlayerScripts

> `Instance`
>
> Stub. [StarterPlayerScripts](../classes/starter-player-scripts.md)

<br/>

### ServerScriptService

> `Instance`
>
> ServerScriptService contains [Scripts](../classes/script.md) that run when the server starts. [ServerScriptService](../classes/server-script-service.md)

<br/>

### Lighting

> Unavailable in the tested runtime
>
> `game:GetService("Lighting")` rejects this service in both Script and
> LocalScript in Vortex Studio 0.3.4. [Lighting](../classes/lighting.md)

<br/>

## Testing Notes

These observations are from Vortex Studio 0.3.4 and may differ in later
releases.

`game.Workspace` and `game:GetService("Workspace")` both report `ClassName`
and `Name` as `Workspace`. `game.OnClose` starts as `nil`; assigning a
function succeeds, but callback delivery has not been established.
