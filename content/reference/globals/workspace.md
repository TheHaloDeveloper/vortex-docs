The `workspace` keyword represents game's root [Workspace](/content/reference/classes/workspace.md) service, which contains all physical models, parts, and other [Instances](/content/reference/classes/instance.md) that can exist inside of it.

It can be used to index specific [Instances](/content/reference/classes/instance.md) or to collect objects quickly, in respect to the server or client's current understanding.

> [!WARNING]
> Instances may be unavailable when loading. Make sure instances exist before accessing.
> Failure to do so may result in runtime errors.
