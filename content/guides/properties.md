description: Read and write instance properties safely in Vortex.

## Reading and writing

Properties are read with dot syntax and written with assignment. The available
properties depend on the instance class and, for character state, 
on runtime authority rules.
```lua
local part = Instance.new("Part")
part.Transparency = 0.5
print(part.Transparency) -- 0.5
part:Destroy()
```

Temporary Parts in Vortex Studio 0.3.4 have writable appearance,
transform, collision, anchoring, and name properties. A live character's
Humanoid health and the root part's transform state are not writable, even from a
server Script.

## Checking optional properties

Vortex commonly returns `nil` for an unsupported property rather than raising
an error on the read. Use `pcall` when a property may be inaccessible or when 
distinguishing between an unavailable member and a failed read matters.

```lua
local ok, value = pcall(function()
    return object.SomeOptionalProperty
end)

if ok and value ~= nil then
    print(value)
end
```

## Change signals

`Changed`, `GetPropertyChangedSignal`, and attribute-change signals can be 
present and connectable without firing after a property write. Poll the
property when correct behavior depends on observing a change. See
[Signals](/content/reference/datatypes/signal.md) and
[Attributes](/content/guides/attributes.md).
