# Summary

`Instances` are the basic building blocks of objects in a game. Each concrete class has its own [`Properties`](./properties.md) and methods.

You can create a new `Instance` using the [`Instance.new`](../reference/globals/instance-new.md) method in a script by passing the `Instance`'s `ClassName` as the first argument.

Vortex does not currently expose one universal base API on every engine-backed value. For example, `Part` exposes common hierarchy methods while `Player` and
`Humanoid` do not. Check the concrete class reference before using a method. 
The [Instance reference](../reference/classes/instance.md) contains the availability matrix tested in Vortex Studio 0.3.4
