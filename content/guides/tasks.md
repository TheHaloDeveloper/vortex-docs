## Available helpers

Vortex Studio 0.3.4 provides `task.spawn`, `task.defer`, `task.delay`, and
`task.wait` in both Script and LocalScript. See the full
[`task`](/content/reference/globals/task.md) reference.

```lua
task.spawn(function()
    print("runs immediately in the current scheduling call")
end)

task.defer(function()
    print("runs on a later scheduler cycle")
end)

task.delay(1, function()
    print("runs after approximately one second")
end)
```

## Scheduling behavior

`task.spawn` completed during the scheduling call in the tested runtime.
`task.defer` and `task.delay(0, callback)` remained pending after the first
`task.wait()` and completed during the second scheduler cycle. `task.wait()`
returns an elapsed-time number.

`task.cancel`, `task.desynchronize`, and `task.synchronize` are unavailable.
